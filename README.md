# Contact Manager - POOSD Small Project Team 5

## Project Overview

Our project is a Personal Contact Manager, designed to help users manage their personal contacts efficiently. Each user has a unique account, allowing them to add, search, edit, and delete their own contacts without sharing them with others. The project includes a clean and professional user interface and utilizes a remote server for hosting and data storage.

### Key Features

- User Authentication: Users can log in or register for a new account.
- Contact Management: Users can add, search, edit, and delete personal contacts.
- Remote Hosting: The application is hosted on a remote server, accessible via a domain name.
- API Integration: Communication between the client and server uses JSON, with at least one API endpoint demonstrated using SwaggerHub.
- AJAX-Enabled Web Page: The client-side interface dynamically interacts with the server.

## Project Requirements

Use a LAMP stack. (Please do not use any Python-based framework)
Use JSON to communicate between client and server. During the presentation, you must show access to at least one API endpoint using SwaggerHub.
You will use a web page as the client. (A web page must be AJAX enabled that accesses the API.)

The program is a personal contact manager. Each user needs a login. If someone does not have an account, you need to offer a registration/signup mechanism. For each user, they can add their own contacts (not shared contacts). They can search for, edit, and delete contacts. When the initial page appears, users can either log in or sign up (register).

Please note: you must have a search API and not cache all contacts client side.

The user interface should be clean and professional. The project should be as professional as possible. The source and support files must be in github (You will add the link to the sign up sheet).
